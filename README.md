## Objectives 

- Create a low-budget robotic hand prototype with finger articulation.
- Use an Arduino board to control finger movement via servo motors.
- Explore basic bio-inspired robotics concepts. 
- Practice embedded programming and prototyping skills.

## Materials 

- Arduino Uno board
- Breadboard 
- Jumper wires 
- Servo motors 
- Materials for the structure 

## Planned features 

- Finger articulation using servo motors
- Simple movement sequences triggered by button or serial input
- Modular code for easy testing of each component 
- Optional : control interface

## To-Do

- Define finger mechanics and number of joints
- Choose number and type of servo motors 
- Build the hand skeleton 
- Connect servos to Arduino 
- Write basic code to control each servo 
- Test finger movement individually
- Create movement sequences
